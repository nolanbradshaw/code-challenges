Input Parameters:
- 2 collections of strings

Create a function that will determine if the two collections have common elements.

Consider what happens if the collections are of different sizes (or one is empty).
Avoid solutions that are O(n^2) (nested loops).

Example:

input: ['a','b','c','d','e'], ['f','g','h','c','i']
