Input parameters:
- A collection of integers 
- An integer (Sum to compute)

Create a function with will find if the collection contains a pair of integers thats sum equals the given integer.

You can assume that the collection is already sorted.

Example:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5], 7
Output: True

The output is True because the collection contains a pair thats sum is equal to 7. (2,5), (3,4)

Bonus:
Make your function return all pairs that equal the sum rather than just a bool.
